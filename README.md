# survey-example

Example staff survey for technical test - not a real project.

In advance of the technical test, clone this repo.

Push your copy of the repository to a suitable service so that we can see the results (eg GitLab or GitHub). That is, don't push changes to this repo, as multiple people will be completing the technical test.

Before taking the technical test, ensure that you can get the Django app up and running (instructions below). Also make sure that you are able to make changes to the codebase and create pull requests in your repo. Make sure that this repo is public so assessors can see your code.

The technical test will consist of a few code-based tasks (making changes to this repo). There will also be a couple of related questions for discussion. These discussions will give you a chance to demonstrate your wider technical skills, and show how you can turn user requirements into technical requirements.
